# Color quiz (Google Chrome browser extension)

Color quiz is a small Google Chrome training extension. The main idea is to get some practice to understand what the color is on the screen and provide a correct answer. The extension is good for front-end devs and designers and for everyone how wants to test attentiveness and knowledge of colors and their hex values.
